# tarot-reading

Tarot Reading is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript responsive mobile-first project that acts like a simple game that displays a one card tarot reading.

[@kkarrwrites](https://github.com/kkarrwrites) created this project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is [@kkarrwrites](https://github.com/kkarrwrites)'s first web development portfolio project.

## Lessons Learned

I learned a variety of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript guidelines and rules while coding this project.

Guidelines and rules I incorporated into this project included:

- ✔️ Add **defer** to the **script src** attribute to place JavaScript link in the **head** of an HTML page.
- ✔️ Write CSS **colors** in **HSL**.
- ✔️ Write CSS **font sizes** in **REMs**.
- ✔️ Write CSS **media queries** in **EMs**.
- ✔️ Minimum widths are primarily used for **mobile-first** CSS.

Guidelines and rules I failed to incorporate into this project, but learned about afterward included:

- ❌ **Classes** should be used over **IDs**.
- ❌ **Header** and **footer** tags should be included inside the **body** tag.

## Credits

Tarot Reading was designed and coded by [@kkarrwrites](https://github.com/kkarrwrites) in 2022.

The [Tarot Vector Background](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-mystical-background_18493566.htm) header image was created by [colorvector](https://www.freepik.com/author/coolvector) and is available on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com).

Alt text descriptions for the tarot cards were adapted from [The Pictorial Key to the Tarot by Arthur Edward Waite, with illustrations by Pamela Colman Smith (1911)](https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/index.htm), a public domain source. Currently, this project includes basic descriptions for the Major Arcana; however, descriptions for the Minor Arcana remain incomplete.
