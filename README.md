# tarot-reading

Tarot Reading is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript responsive mobile-first project that acts like a simple game that displays a one card tarot reading.

[K. Karr](https://github.com/kkarrwrites/) created this project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is [K. Karr](https://github.com/kkarrwrites/)'s first web development portfolio project.

## Credits

Tarot Reading was designed and coded by [K. Karr](https://github.com/kkarrwrites/) in 2022.

The [Tarot Vector Background](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-mystical-background_18493566.htm) header image was created by [colorvector](https://www.freepik.com/author/coolvector) and is available on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com).

Alt text descriptions for the tarot cards were adapted from [The Pictorial Key to the Tarot by Arthur Edward Waite, with illustrations by Pamela Colman Smith (1911)](https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/index.htm), a public domain source. Currently, this project includes basic descriptions for the Major Arcana; however, descriptions for the Minor Arcana remain incomplete.
